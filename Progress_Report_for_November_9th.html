<h3>Progress Report for November 9, 2016 - Learning to Code I - Margaret Rott</h3>

<!-- At the end of each class we prepare a progress report showing our objectives and accomplishments for the day. -->

<p><b>Objectives: </b>Today I want to learn how to insert Cascading Style Sheets (CSSs) in an html document.</p>

<b>Accomplishments: </b>I practiced the three different methods of inserting CSSs into html documents: external, internal, and inline. For our open house project, I also learned how to add an image file to html coding so that it displays in the browser.</p>

<br>

<!-- The time always flies by. I will practice both CSS coding and the procedure for our new project in my free time. -->
